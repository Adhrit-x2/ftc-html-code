                        In our pursuit of enhanced capabilities, we actively engaged with our local STEM community to access their machine shop. 
                        With the guidance of a knowledgeable mentor, we explored the facilities and received invaluable assistance in machining custom parts. 
                        This collaboration not only expanded our technical expertise but also fostered a stronger sense of community within the STEM realm, setting the stage for future innovation and success.
                        Through this partnership, we not only gained access to essential resources but also cultivated meaningful connections, emphasizing the importance of collaboration in pushing the boundaries of innovation

                        Alessandra and Amanda went to a local public school to introduce them to FTC and FLL. 
                        They went to the fifth grade classes and presented FTC to them. 
                        Showing them all the different concepts of FIRST robotics. 
                        Each hour long presentation ended with activities incorporating parts of robotics and learning how each part of our robot worked together to complete a common goal. 
                        By the conclusion of our presentation, many fifth grade students were asking how they could start their own robotics team.

                        Aarush, Jake, and Ryan created an FTC slideshow and presented it 10+ times during an open house event at Oakwood School. 
                        This slideshow walked the audience through the challenge and described what FTC meant to us. 
                        In between presentations, we spoke individually to families about these topics. 
                        We also displayed our robot and its mechanisms to the visitors. 
                        In total, over 200 families attended this event.

                        Team members Ethan, Adhrit, and Jeremy all created brochures and went around various schools and locations and handed out the brochures with the website on them as well as summarizing what we do here at Oakwood. 
                        On the website we have our ideas, ongoing cad projects, social media, and our journey through the season. 
                        We have an active discord server including teams Techie Pizza & Build a Bot.

                        In Partnership with the Santa Clara County Library, we put on a series of events to teach and engage kids about robotics and FIRST. 
                        A total of 50+ kids in the community attended to learn more about robotics. 
                        We were able to show off our robot and allow the kids to experiment with Holonomic driving capabilities by letting them drive our Outreach Robot. 
                        Then, we used Dash & Dot robotics kits to teach kids how to program and drive their own robot.
