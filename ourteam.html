                                Dillon has been with Oakwood's robotics program for three years now.
                                He joined the middle school FTC team when he was in eighth grade, and
                                has been a veteran since. He is also a passionate participant in Oakwood's
                                spacecraft program, which has recently been selected as part of NASA's
                                CubeSat Launch Initiative. Besides robotics, Dillon enjoys mountain
                                biking and running cross country. This year, Dillon was only a sophomore
                                but he took it upon himself to be the team leader. He was an integral
                                part of this year's success, not only with his leadership skills but
                                also by being one of the most hardworking mechanical builders.

                                being one of our only CAD designers. He designed multiple parts for the
                                robot and was vital for the team's achievement.

                                main CAD designers and collaborated with them to produce parts for the
                                robot. Adhrit took countless hours out of his days to perfect his designs
