                        We had two claw designs last year. 
                        Using the Fusion 360 CAD software, we designed multiple iterations of the grippy claw design. 
                        Through many cycles of designing, printing, and modifying the component, we learned a great deal about the engineering design process and how compliant mechanisms work. 
                        We eventually settled on a symmetrical u-shape that slants downwards to fit the shape of the cone better.
                        With our new claw design we hope to eliminate problems we encountered with the old claw design such as instability, weight, gripping abilities, and cone funneling abilities. 
                        Our current design of the claw consists of two types of plastic.
                        The PLA, Polylactic acid plastic, is the red component and is the solid hard structure of the claw. 
                        The TPU, Thermoplastic Polyurethane plastic, is the white component. 
                        This plastic is flexible and provides the best grip out of all the different materials we have tested. <br> <br>

                        Reverse 4-Bar Mechanism:
                        Using a reverse virtual 4-bar for our wrist allows us to rotate around the end of our arm in a scorpion shape. 
                        This technique prevents the cone from being scored upside-down, and is quick and only requires the use of one servo. 
                        Using one servo to power 2 points of rotation is not only significantly lighter and therefore faster than 2 servos, but it also reduces the number of wires going down to the control hub.
                        Scorpion:
                        Our first prototype consisted of a wrap around hook shape that was very bulky and wasn’t very sturdy. 
                        Double Servo:	
                        Our second prototype used 2 identical servo systems that turned in unison to achieve the degree of rotation that we need.
                        Virtual Reverse 4-Bar:	          
                        Our third prototype and current design uses gears to rotate the second segment of the wrist at the same rate as the first while keeping the entire system light and compact. <br> <br>

                        Gorail Bearing Spacer:
                        We designed and printed this piece several times to get the  best stability. 
                        The two pieces work together to hold the bearings in the right place on the Gorail.
                        Electronics Deck:
                        We decided that we wanted to protect the electronics, so we created a deck to make sure our control and expansion hubs won’t get damaged from physical shock. 
                        Our deck was designed in CAD and laser cut out of acrylic in a CNC machine. 
                        Since we don’t have access to multiple sheets of acrylic, we had to make absolutely sure that we had our measurements correct.
                        U-channel End Cap:
                        We created an end cap for our drive base’s u-channels to prevent damage to other robots and the field.
                        Beacon:
                        We wanted a beacon that would work so we can score both the beacon and the cone at the same time. For this to work, we printed the beacon out of TPU so that it would comply with the cone and stick with it as it goes through our scoring procedure. <br> <br>

                        This year for our autonomous program, we implemented the use of trapezoidal
                        motion to have more accuracy and prevent loss of traction in the wheels. For
                        machine vision, using Vuforia, we created code to use the pictures placed on
                        the field walls to determine the position of the robot. We also implemented
                        a motion axis for the robot's motors that includes the trapezoidal motion math
                        and takes into account axis limits to prevent overextension and damage.

                        For the driver-controlled period, we developed code that commands our arm
                        to autonomously line up with the junctions, which immensely improved our
                        cycle times. To make it easier for the drivers, we cubed the stick input
                        values to make driving more precise for smaller inputs. We also implemented
                        forward kinematics by using the angle and length of the arm to determine
                        where the claw is. We used inverse kinematics to find the length and angle
                        of the arm given a point.
