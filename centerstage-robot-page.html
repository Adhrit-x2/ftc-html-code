                <p class="first-paragraph">The objective of the game was to score pixels on a backboard while also having robots on a strict height limit. 
                    Your team could score more points with making mosaics. 
                    Another way to score was with a "drone" which was a paper airplan that needed to be lauched a certain distance to get 30 more points<br><br>Check out our Centerstage robot!</p>

                        Our Intake was an active rake mechanism this year.
                        Since the pixels were an odd shape we needed to devise a plan to pick them effectivly.
                        This lead us to trying to rack them into a funnel that puts it on to our Tray CAD part.

                    <p>
                        For scoring on the backboard we decided to first centeralize the pixels onto a certain area and then let them fall one by one. 
                        We also used 2 lift kits to lift the tray CAD part to the board.

                        This year's robot had multiple CAD parts which were the spool, tray, and side panels for our intake mech.
                        The spool mostly tried to lift the robot as that was another way of gaining points.
                        The tray was a part used to put the parts into a centeralized area to move to the board.
                        Lastly the side pannels was another custom part used to hold the intake as close to the ground as possible.

                        The drive base was the StraferÂ® Chassis Kit with the 96mm mecanum wheels. 
                        From our last year's robot we already had this built and this year we just shortened the distance between the two sides.
                        This specific drive base is very veratile because it can move diagonaly while staying straight for example.

                        This year we worked very hard towards having a successful autonomous program.
                        Unfortunately, our efforts were stopped short, though we accomplished many
                        things that will be useful to us in later seasons. We
                        worked towards finishing a Kalman Filter that allowed
                        us to take a sample of data, usually an image, and filter
                        it to remove noise and get more precise data. We also
                        created an autonomous program that allowed us to move
                        anywhere on the field and implemented a coordinate system
                        that allowed the robot to know where it was on the field
                        at a given moment with relatively good precision.

                    <p>
                        This year we had very efficient TeleOP code that allowed us
                        to have a quick cycle time for scoring. One obstacle
                        we faced was defining limits for the motors so that
                        our lift kits would not break. We also decided to automate
                        certain processes in the TeleOP period using autonomous
                        code. To make it easier for the drivers, we cubed the
                        controller's sticks' input values to allow for more precise
                        adjustments given smaller values.
